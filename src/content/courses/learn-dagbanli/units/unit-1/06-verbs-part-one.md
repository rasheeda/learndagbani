### First, Second and Third Person Verbs

**First Person** As in English, the first, second and third person verbs can also be achieved in Dagbanli. Each action (or state) references a person. In other words: Who? Who is doing it? Or, who is in that state? We call it the "person." When the verb shows an action or a state of the person speaking, we say the verb is in the first person. Examples;

*   **Ni chɛŋ karimzɔŋ/shikuru** - I will go to school
*   **N yuri buku karimbu** - I love reading books
*   **Ti nyuri kɔm** - We drink water

  **Second Person** When the verb shows an action or a state of the person you are speaking to, we say the verb is in the second person. Examples;

*   **A gbihiri pam** - You sleep a lot
*   **A guuri pam** - You run a lot
*   **A mi bɔl’li ŋmebu venyɛlinga** - You know how to play football well

  **Third Person** When the verb shows an action or a state of someone else, which is not present, we say the verb is in the third person. Examples;

*    **O** **mi bɔl’li ŋmeb venyɛlinga** **\-** He/She knows how to play football well
*   **Di tumda** \- It works
*   **Bi guurimi** \- They are running
