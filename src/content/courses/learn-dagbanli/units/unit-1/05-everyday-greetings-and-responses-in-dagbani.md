Just like any language, there are formal and informal greetings in Dagbani. Dagbamba's take greetings **VERY SERIOUSLY**. It's the basic and most intrinsic way of opening up conversations and especially acknowledging and showing respect. 

Usually in the Dagomba culture, younger folks must greet older folks when they meet them. If you are greeting someone older than you, you're expected to kneel. A simple hunch over could also do, but it's considered partly informal, so going all the way down on the knees is a perfect show of respect. 

Depending on the 'status' of the person you're greeting, usually a King or Queen, you clap upon each response (while saying n'naa) - example greeting video coming soon. People are also expected to greet those they don't know when walking past them. 

It's a very important part of the culture and people take it seriously, so don't forget to randomly greet people if you're ever in Dagbon. It's a a respectful gesture and highly appreciated.
